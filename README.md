I have experience with Lua and basic understanding of C++ and Assembly. My main passion is security, reverse engineering and business management.

I don’t really have a lot of open-source projects as a lot of what I do is confidential and proprietary. Any projects I can open source, I usually will post about them on the Roblox Developer Forum - if they’re related to Roblox.

Any opinions I share are my own.
