<h3>üçï About Me</h3>
I have experience with Lua, JavaScript and basic understanding of C++ and Assembly. My main passion is security, playing around with machine learning and business management.<br/><br/>

I don‚Äôt really have a lot of open-source projects as a lot of what I do is confidential and proprietary. Any projects I can open source, I usually will post about them on the Roblox Developer Forum - if they‚Äôre related to Roblox.

Any opinions I share are my own.

<h3>üöÄ Projects</h3>

* **Roblox Model File Decoder**<br/>
This is a basic utility written in Roblox Lua to be able to read Roblox model files which are encoded with Roblox's binary format.<br>
